                <p>This was my last sewing project of winter 2024: a cross-body, medium capacity cycling bag. The idea was to create a bag that could carry everything necessary for a full day outside the house, but keep it small enough to comfortably wear while biking. I designed it with dedicated internal pockets and maximized external storage though netting and cinch straps. The size and general shape were initially prototyped, with fabric choice, details, and hardware then chosen during the construction process. 

I have reached the point in gear sewing where I have a substantial amount of leftover fabric, straps, and buckles from previous projects. I wanted to make this bag entirely out of scrap materials to divert these small pieces from the waste stream and as a creative challenge. The final bag turned out close to what I had envisioned. It is slightly less structured than I imagined, which was due to the use of low denier fabrics, but holds its shape well when filled. 

The bag features a single large enclosure with five internal pockets, a zipper front pocket, two side pockets, shock cord netting on top, bottom cinch straps, U-Lock holster, bike handlebar mounts, shoulder stabilizer strap, and adjustable center buckle 

Main bag: reclaimed 420D Robic + 5oz + 2.9oz Dyneema

                <p>road crunched: 160.02 miles

time passed: 10.75 hours

This august, I biked around Mt Rainer in the course of one day. The route is typically done as part of the race: Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day (RAMROD) and is the shortest complete circumnavigation of the 14,410’ volcano on paved roads. Since the race was not taking place in 2024, I decided to attempt the ride solo and unsupported. I began at sunrise in Enumclaw traveling clockwise so the majority of the elevation gain would be in the first half of the day. The first 80 miles consisted of peaceful, backroad climbing to Cayuse pass, entering the park, and then reaching the high point at 5400ft. I got to the Paradise Inn feeling equally euphoric and depleted. I had told myself that reaching this halfway point would be my marker of success for the trip and going forward, I could bail whenever was necessary. 

The descent down Longmire was a delightful demonstration of potential energy, until my rear hub broke and I was no longer able to coast. The remaining 60 miles of the route, I had to keep the petals in constant motion to prevent the back wheel from emminating a nasty grinding sound. Pure momentum pushed me through to the starting point, arriving just after sunset. The visual and mental perspective offered by circuiting a landmass this size was humbling. This was my longest ride to date, and a massive personal accomplishment for my long distance cycling endeavors. </p>

                <p>I moved into an apartment with no furniture, and by necessity, I have decided to delve into carpentry. The idea was sparked by two cosmetically challenged but structurally pristine Ikea tables I found on the side of the road. They were solid wood which is a rarity in this age of composite materials and I deemed them worthy of transformation. Each table top was split, notches for the legs, and refinished. I shortened the original legs so that the shelf would sit just below the height of our living room window sill. To make them visually appealing, I secured the shelves with horizontal pegs, giving the appearance that the shelves are floating. Given that I arbitrarily created their design for the aesthetics, I wasn’t sure they would be structurally sound. So far though, they have bared more than their own weight in plants and book. </p>

Continuously, I aspire to take these wheels further off pavement and onto the dirt and rocks where they belong. This was their first majority singletrack trip and my first excursion in british columbia. The sea to sky route follows the cheakamus, squamish, and green rivers, starting in the coast range and ending in the howe sound. It alternates between deeply forested roads and riverside singletrack, which provided an exhilarating ride on a rigid-framed gravel bike. The route is still incomplete so there were sections of shoulder riding and stretches were the trail was too chunky to ride through and had to be hiked. Overall the trip was a success, although the increasingly predictable smoke of the late summer pacific northwest added an unwelcome visual and aromatic effect. I would highly recommend this route for a short and punchy overnight trip. </p>

                <p>For this sewing project, I created an unwieldy, high-volume handlebar bag as the latest addition to my bikepacking kit. Made from waterproof technical fabric, I intentionally reversed the face to show the striking, geometric lamination. The final bag went thorough several iterations to minimize rocking during intense climbs and allow ease of access to top and side pockets on my drop-bar bike. 

This bag was my first project made without a pattern or prototyping. I decided on the rough sizing for the bag, and then worked backwards to determine the shape and size of each pattern piece. I enjoy working on open ended projects both because of the space it provides for customization as well as the mental challenge of sewing without knowing the end product. Sewing in this way I’ve found requires careful attention to the order of operations. I often had to think multiple steps ahead to determine how pieces would be connected before deciding their form or dimensions. 

The bag features a large main compartment with drawstring closure, zippered side and top pockets, fiberglass stabilization and structural reinforcements, and numerous attachment points.

                <p>The recommendation algorithms of music streaming platforms have become increasingly personalized to the point of only suggesting music within the genres a user already likes. These algorithms are to the detriment of music taste expansion and listening as an actively engaged activity. This music recommendation application serves to broaden music discovery through anonymization of the algorithm requests. The application takes an input artist and fetches a playlist of related songs controlled for popularity.

                <p>This bag is the first piece of technical outdoor gear I’ve sewn. It happened immediately on the heels of discovering the make-your-own-gear (myog) community and the almost limitless possibilities of home-sewn gear. In my mind and I imagine many others, there is a disconnect between the things we use and how they are made. This introduction to the concept of home-sewn gear lifted the illusion that technical bags required hyper-specialized machinery to manufacture. 

Motivated by the creative potential and utility sewing offers, I decided to establish the fundamentals with a basic ultralight backpacking bag. I didn’t yet have the knowledge to make a custom pattern, so I prototyped the bag off a popular design by hyperlite mountain gear. Referencing detailed measurements and diagrams taken from an existing bag, I recreated the design using similar high-performance fabrics and notions. The bag presented logistical hurdles being made on a non-industrial sewing machine, but I made accommodations through altering the design. The first iteration was mistakenly made with all purpose nylon thread. After a few months of daily use, the seams began to unravel rendering the bag useless. 

With a week long backpacking trip on the benton mackaye trail approaching, I dissected the bag down to its individual components, made some alternations to the internal frame, and resewed it using high-performance thread. The bag has now held up over 800 miles in its current iteration and continues to function well. There are many changes I would make, which have already begun informing the design for my second backpacking pack.

Nothing parallels walking alone in the mountains. For me, only backcountry solitude so acutely conjures the sense of being strikingly in my own body and mind. Following a desire for an extended period of wandering and reflection, I formed a plan for a four part solo trek in the eastern alps. The trip would consist of: the tour du mont blanc, a tour of vanoise, and alta via one + two. As my strength increased and the weather warmed, each successive route would move faster and with more days between resupplying. 

The tour du mont blanc was a gentle welcome to the alpine with heavily trafficked trails and frequent refuges to snack and caffeinate. Compared to the remoteness of the american backcountry, it was jarring to be so isolated and then come upon a packed refuge with a gondola to the valley floor. In contrast, vanoise was a dissolution of frontcountry life and complete immersion into the alpine. Each day following an arc from the familiar to the obscure and back, as I passed through high mountain passes devoid of vegetation. I spent the entire week hovering above 8000 feet and with off-grid refuges a days walk apart. 

While the dolomites are lower altitude, the contrast of alpine meadows butted against rough, rocky outcroppings was no less captivating. The exposed sections of via ferrata and frequent lightning storms served as a harrowing finale to the overall adventure, simultaneously building my confidence, route finding, and comfort in high-pressure circumstances. I walked the alta via one northbound, had a rest day in bruneck, and returned on alta via two southbound. The last day, hiking down the foothills with a wall of fog obscuring everything below the sheer cliffs, it felt like the culmination of a months-long dream sequence and as the flowing traverses brought me steadily back to the real world. </p>

This was my first ever bikepacking trip and a thoroughly enchanting initiation at over nine hundred miles in the course of two weeks. The route closely traces the pacific coast, alternating between highway 1 and 101, and country roads. By choosing to embark southbound, I got a picturesque view of the coast not interrupted by passing cars, and the advantage of the predictable northerly winds. 

Bikepacking strikes me as the sweet-spot between pedestrian and vehicle travel. It is at once fast enough to see entire regions and ranges in the course of days, yet slow enough that every scene can be taken in. The variation of this stretch of coast added a novelty to each day that was punctuated by consistent and rhythmic periods of climbing. The first week passed through each rocky southern oregon inlet, which offered the seriousness of passing logging trucks, but also an almost mythical abundance of blackberries, fog enshrouded beaches, and ocean-weathered rock. 

The route passes into california and the avenue of the giants – an energetically stunning and almost clandestine stretch of old growth forest that the road seems to naturally meander through. Emerging from the avenue, I rode into the diametrically contrasted eel river valley. A hot and horrid section of non-existent highway shoulder riding that left me questioning my persuit of this sport. As quickly as it entered, the route forks out of the valley and up to the elevation high point for the entire pacific coast at leggett hill. After the whiplash of physical and emotional extremes, the route offered the salve of three tranquil days riding along isolated coastal road. I passed through farms and pacific bluffs that became increasingly suburban before crossing the golden gate bridge into san francisco. </p>
