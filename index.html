                    <p class="post-content">    I've always felt that a lot of outdoor gear isn't great. The balance between form, functionality, price, durability, weight, and most importantly ~color~ is very subjective. It's impossible for a widely produced item not to fall short in one area or another. My discovery that people sew gear themselves was therefore revolutionary. The -aptly named- Make Your Own Gear (myog) community is surprisingly large and sources the same highly-engineered materials that commercial brands have access to. Sewing skills willing, I realized that almost all the camping gear I use could be sewn or made exactly to my specifications. 
                        <br><br>
                        In an admittedly zealous first attempt, I decided to sew a ultralight backpacking pack. Since I did not have previous experience prototyping or using patterns, I decided to base my initial design off of a popular pack from Hyperlite Mountain Gear, with modifications to make it more comfortable and lighter. I found the actual process of sewing to be significantly easier than figuring out the logistical order-of-operations for constructing it with clean seams. Despite a significant amount of ripping out mistake stitches, it turned out better than I expected. As to whether the bottom falls out in the field, only time will tell. </p>
