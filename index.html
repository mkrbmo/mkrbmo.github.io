                            <p>This past year, I moved to Seattle in large part to have access to the abundance of bike-packing routes within the Pacific Northwest. As I work my way across the Olympic/Cascades mountains and the islands of the Pudget Sound, I wanted to document my trips cartographically. This cycling map project uses python scrips to pull GPX data from the strava api and convert it into geojson. Those routes are then displayed using a leaflet map. Click through to explore my adventures by year.</p>

                            <p>Depending on the current iteration of the Spotify recommendation algorithm, the suggestions can be exceedingly personalized. Users are often given recommendations that fall close to their current artists and genres, making it difficult to expand their taste through the algorithmic playlists and stations. In an effort to find broader music recommendations, I created a web application to provide related artists recommendations from the Spotify API. The user inputs an artist name and a playlist is generated with songs controlled for popularity. The songs can be previewed and either removed or added to the suggestion seed to make the playlist more similar to that song. New songs can be populated into the playlist until it is a desired length. The completed playlist can then be named and saved to the users Spotify account.</p>

                            <p>I've always felt that a lot of outdoor gear isn't great. The balance between form, functionality, price, durability, weight, and most importantly ~color~ is very subjective. It's impossible for a widely produced item not to fall short in one area or another. My discovery that people sew gear themselves was therefore revolutionary. The -aptly named- Make Your Own Gear (myog) community is surprisingly large and sources the same highly-engineered materials that commercial brands have access to. Sewing skills willing, I realized that almost all the camping gear I use could be sewn or made exactly to my specifications.</p>

                            <p>I love walking in the mountains alone. Nothing conjures an equivalent sense of being so strikingly in your own body or mind. This past summer, my desire for an extended period of wandering and reflection brought me to the French and Italian alps. In the course of nearly two months of sleeping in the dirt, I backpacked Parc National de la Vanoise, the Tour du Mont Blanc, a northbound traverse of Alta Via 1, and southbound Alta Via 2.</p>
