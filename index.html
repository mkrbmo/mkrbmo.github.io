                            For a period of time, the Spotify recommendations were overly personalized to the point it provided songs you already listened to rather than introducing you to new music. I developed a web application which utilizes the Spotify API to recommend songs related to an artist. The user inputs an artist name and a playlist is generated with songs controlled for popularity. The songs can be previewed and either removed or added to the suggestion seed to make the playlist more similar to that song. New songs can be populated into the playlist until it is a desired length. The completed playlist can then be named and saved to the users Spotify account.

                    <p class="post-content">    I've always felt that a lot of outdoor gear isn't great. The balance between form, functionality, price, durability, weight, and most importantly ~color~ is very subjective. It's impossible for a widely produced item not to fall short in one area or another. My discovery that people sew gear themselves was therefore revolutionary. The -aptly named- Make Your Own Gear (myog) community is surprisingly large and sources the same highly-engineered materials that commercial brands have access to. Sewing skills willing, I realized that almost all the camping gear I use could be sewn or made exactly to my specifications. 
                        <br><br>
                        In an admittedly zealous first attempt, I decided to sew a ultralight backpacking pack. Since I did not have previous experience prototyping or using patterns, I decided to base my initial design off of a popular pack from Hyperlite Mountain Gear, with modifications to make it more comfortable and lighter. I found the actual process of sewing to be significantly easier than figuring out the logistical order-of-operations for constructing it with clean seams. Despite a significant amount of ripping out mistake stitches, it turned out better than I expected. As to whether the bottom falls out in the field, only time will tell. </p>
