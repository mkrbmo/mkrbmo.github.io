                <p>Last project of 2024 winter: a cross-body cycling bag made entirely out of scrap materials. Designed for the utility of daily use with dedicated pockets and maximized external storage though netting and cinch straps. The size and general shape were initially prototyped, with fabric choice, details, and hardware then chosen during the construction process. 

The bag features a single large enclosure with five internal pockets, a zipper front pocket, two side pockets, shock cord netting on top, bottom cinch straps, U-Lock holster, bike handlebar mounts, shoulder stabilizer strap, and adjustable center buckle

Main bag: reclaimed 420D Robic + 5oz Dyneema
Lining: ECOPAK EPX200
Top + Bottom: 210D Dyneema Gridstop</p>

The route is typically done as part of the race: Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day (RAMROD) and is the shortest complete circumnavigation of the 14,410â€™ mountain on paved roads. Since the race was not taking place in 2024, this ride was done solo and unsupported on a sunny day mid-august. It began in enumclaw traveling clockwise so the elevation gain would be early in the day. After 80 miles of peaceful backroad riding and three mountain passes, the high point of Paradise Inn was reached. A leisurely 80 more miles of downhill and suburban riding followed to reach the starting point just after sunset. The visual and mental perspective offered by circuiting a landmass this size is humbling and a true testament to the power of glucose. </p>

Continuously, these two wheels are moving further off pavement and onto the dirt and rocks where they belong. This was their first majority singletrack trip and a relatively chossy introduction. The route follows the sea to sky corridor along the cheakamus, squamish, and green rivers, starting in the northern cascades and ending in the howe sound. It alternates between deeply forested roads and riverside singletrack which provided a gripping ride on a rigid-framed gravel bike. </p>

Made from waterproof high-performance fabric intentionally reversed to show the striking, geometric lamination. The bag can stably hang off the handlebars or be installed on a rack. The final bag went thorough several iterations to minimize rocking during intense climbs and allow ease of access to top and side pockets on narrow drop-bar bikes. 

The bag features a large main compartment with drawstring closure, zippered side and top pockets, fiberglass stabilization and structural reinforcements, and numerous attachment points.

                <p>The recommendation algorithms of music streaming platforms have become increasingly personalized to the point of only suggesting music within the genres a user already likes. These algorithms are to the detriment of music taste expansion and listening as an actively engaged activity. This music recommendation application serves to broaden music discovery through anonymization of the algorithm requests. The application takes an input artist and fetches a playlist of related songs controlled for popularity. Songs can be previewed and either removed or added to the recommendation seed to shift the playlist towards that sound. Completed playlists are then saved to the users spotify account. 

This project was made using the python flask library for the application GUI and functionality. Requests are made to the spotify API and stored locally. The project demonstrates flask web development, implementation of authorization schemas, and interaction with RESTful APIs. See the github repo linked on about page.</p>

                <p>This back is the first in a series of technical outdoor bags meant for back/bikepacking. Without access to patterns, the bag was prototyped off a popular design by hyperlite mountain gear. Referencing detailed measurements and diagrams taken from an existing bag, this pack was then produced using similar high-performance fabrics and notions. The bag presented logistical hurdles being made on a non-industrial sewing machine, which were accommodated through alternations in design. 

Sewing outdoor gear, as popularized by cottage-industry manufacturers and the make-your-own-gear community, offers an outlet for creativity and customization. Home sewn gear allows for material up-cycling from worn or obsolete equipment. The process of sewing bags also imparts the knowledge to mend broken gear and divert it from waste streams.

Nothing parallels walking alone in the mountains. Only alpine solitude so acutely conjures the sense of being strikingly in your own body and mind. Following the desire for an extended period of wandering and reflection, the plan for a four part trek in the eastern alps was formed. The trip consisted of: the tour du mont blanc, a tour of vanoise, and alta via one + two. As strength increased and the weather warmed, each successive route would move faster and with more days between resupply. 

The tour du mont blanc was a gentle welcome to the alpine with heavily trafficked trails and frequent refuges to snack and caffeinate. In contrast, vanoise was a dissolution of frontcountry life and complete immersion into the subalpine. Each day spent hovering above 8000 feet and with off-grid refuges a days walk apart. While the dolomites are lower altitude, the contrast of alpine meadows butted against rough, rocky outcroppings was no less captivating. The exposed sections of via ferrata and frequent lightning storms served as a harrowing finale to the tripâ€™s narrative arc. but made the sunny, flowing traverses feel like extended walking mediation.</p>

Going over: 2 weeks

First ever Bikepacking trip and a thoroughly enchanting initiation at over nine hundred miles in the course of two weeks. This route closely traces the pacific coast, alternating between highway 1 and 101, and country roads. Choosing to embark southbound allowed for an uninterrupted view of the coast and the advantage of the notherly winds. 

Bikepacking sits at the sweet-spot between pedestrian and vehicle travel. It is at once fast enough to see entire regions and ranges in the course of days, yet slow enough that every scene can be taken in. The variation of this stretch of coast added a novelty to each day that was punctuated by consistent and rhythmic periods of climbing. After a week of coastal riding along the rocky southern oregon coast, the route enters the avenue of the giants â€“ an energetically stunning and almost clandestine stretch of old growth forest. Emerging from the avenue, one travels into the eel river valleyâ€™s equally hot and harrowing section of non-existent highway shoulder riding. The route forks then into the elevation high point for the entire pacific coast at leggett hill. After the whiplash of physical and emotional extremes, the route offers the salve of three tranquil days of isolated coastal roads passing through farms and pacific bluffs before landing in san francisco. </p>
